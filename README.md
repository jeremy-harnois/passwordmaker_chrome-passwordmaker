# PasswordMaker.org Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome Extension that implements the PasswordMaker.org method for generating a unique, secure password for any site, from a single master password.

This technique has been widely used since 2003, though it has been eclipsed by generators that create a random password for each site.  The problem with that method is that every generated password must be stored - with the PasswordMaker.org technique you just memorize or record the master password (this master password can not be determined from the generated passwords).

Later, if you switch to a different platform or lose all record of your passwords, you can still easily unlock all your passwords, for all your sites (and on any platform since this same technique is implemented on other platforms) as long as you can remember your master password.

I don't use this plug-in anymore and do not have the time or energy to continue maintainership.
I'm out. It was a nice ride.
