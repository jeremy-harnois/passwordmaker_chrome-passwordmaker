# PasswordMaker.org Browser Extension

This is a browser extension that works for Chrome, Firefox, and other Chromium based browsers which is a flexible password generation tool that creates unique, secure passwords that are very easy for you to generate but no one else.
Your passwords are never stored anywhere, anytime, so there's no database to be hacked, lost, or stolen; unlike the many popular password managers available.

To use, click the golden ring and provide PasswordMaker with at least two pieces of information: 
1) A "master password" -- that one, single password you like
2) The URL of the website requiring a password
3) Customize per website password generation settings (optional)

PasswordMaker will then generate a unique password using a one-way hash algorithm of your choosing to generate a unique password for every website which is both extremely configurable and user friendly.

This technique has been widely used since 2003 and is 100% compatible with the other versions of PasswordMaker for other devices and computers which you can find at [passwordmaker.org](https://www.passwordmaker.org/) for more information.  So, if you switch to a different platform, you can still easily generate all your passwords, for all your sites as long as you can remember your master password and password profile setting for the site.

### For more, see the [passwordmaker.org](https://www.passwordmaker.org/) site.

**_PLEASE Export your profile data_** it is advisable to always keep a back-up of your current profile data.

I don't use this plug-in anymore and do not have the time or energy to continue maintainership.
I'm out. It was a nice ride.
